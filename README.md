## Project Description
UNMC recently started an intiative with AirPurple to monitor air quality conditions across Nebraska. The group opened a request for proposals from engineering firms and independent consultants to help them analyze the air quality data set provided by AirPurple in the months of February 2024 and March 2025. They requested we answer their questions about air quality in Nebraska, by providing potential "hotspots" that may be related to public health concerns. This project's objective is to help the group understand how temperature, humidity, elevation, and geographic location all have an impact on air quality in Nebraska.
